<h1 align="center"> Secure Files, Simplified üîë </h1>

LockByte is an easy-to-use, open-source file encryption application designed to cater to the needs of individuals who prioritise data security and want to protect their data without dealing with complex software. At present, LockByte supports *Windows*, *Linux*, and *Mac*.

Features of LockByte:

- üõ°Ô∏è It utilizes **AES-256 encryption**, the gold standard in symmetric encryption, to ensure your files are securely locked away. AES-256 is known for its robustness and is used globally by governments and security-conscious industries.

- üîí To complement AES-256, LockByte employs **Argon2 password hashing**. Argon2 is the winner of the Password Hashing Competition in 2015 and is renowned for its resistance to GPU cracking attacks, providing an additional layer of security.

- üéØ Despite its advanced security features, LockByte remains accessible to users of all technical backgrounds. The user interface is intuitive, making the process of encrypting files as simple as selecting a file, entering a password, and initiating the encryption process.

## Installation

You can install the application via the platform-specific installers **(recommended)** or as a Python package.

### Standalone Installers

- Windows: [lockbyte_setup.exe](https://github.com/bose-kb/LockByte/releases/latest)
- Linux: [lockbyte_installer.run](https://github.com/bose-kb/LockByte/releases/latest)
- macOS: [lockbyte_installer.pkg](https://github.com/bose-kb/LockByte/releases/latest)

> [!TIP]  
> Since the standalone installers have not been signed (due to the additional cost required to do so), you may get warnings like *Microsoft SmartScreen* warnings on Windows,  *Gatekeeper* warnings on macOS, and a *disabled desktop launcher* shortcut problem on Linux. 
>No need to worry, the installers and executables are completely safe. Check the collapsed sections below for respective workarounds to these problems. 

>[!CAUTION]
>Please ensure the installers you download come directly from this repository.

## App Demo

<details>
<summary>Encryption Steps</summary>

1. Launch the *LockByte app*.
2. Click on the *Encrypt* button on the starting screen.
3. Choose a *File or Folder* whose contents you want to encrypt.
4. Enter a *password* of your choice (**six characters minimum**).
5. Click on the *Encrypt* button at the bottom.
6. *Re-enter* the password and click on the *confirm* button to confirm. *Optionally* you can choose to *keep or delete* your original file(s) post encryption.
7. Once the encryption process is over a *new file* with a `.lockbyte` extension appears in the *same directory* as your chosen file. In case a folder was provided, *all file(s)* inside the *folder* as well as *sub-folder(s)* will get encrypted and saved as *new file(s)* with a `.lockbyte` extension. 
8. You can now delete the original files, (if not already opted to in *Step 6*) and store only the encrypted `.lockbyte` files.

<details>
<summary>Decryption Steps</summary>

1. Launch the *LockByte app*.
2. Click on the *Decrypt* button on the starting screen.
3. Choose a *File or Folder* whose contents you want to decrypt.
4. Enter the *password* you used during encryption.
5. Click on the *Decrypt* button at the bottom.
6. Once the decryption process is over a *new file* with `_decrypted` suffix appended to the file name appears in the *same directory* as your chosen file. In case a folder was provided, *all file(s)* inside the *folder* as well as *sub-folder(s)* will get decrypted and saved as *new file(s)* with `_decrypted` suffix appended to the file names.

*`A quick demo of the application functionality.`*

## Example Program

You can use the `lockbyte.lock_unlock` module to perform encryption and decryption of files.

| Parameter   | Type     | Description                |
| :--------   | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `file_path` | `str`    | Path to your file |
| `file`      | `_io.BufferedReader` | Opened file object |

#### Encryption 

```python
from lockbyte import lock_unlock

user_password = "abcd"  # pick a password

# create an instance of LockByteUser
user = lock_unlock.LockByteUser(passphrase=user_password)
file_path = "test.txt"  # provide path to file to be encrypted

with open(file_path, "rb") as file:
    if user.validate_and_generate(1):  # call validation function
        # call encryption function
        user.encrypt(file=file, file_path=file_path)
```
#### Decryption 

```python
# create another instance of LockByteUser
user = lock_unlock.LockByteUser(passphrase=user_password)
file_path = "test.txt.lockbyte"  # provide path to file to be decrypted

with open(file_path, "rb") as file:
    # call decryption function
    user.decrypt(file=file, file_path=file_path)

```
